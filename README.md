# TransmogDisabler
A simple injectable dll that disables transmog on Turtle-WoW. It allows you to see the real look of people's items instead of what they've transmogged them too.

How to use:
1. Run WoW.exe
2. Run TransmogDisabler.bat
3. Login

Make sure to clear your WDB folder beforehand as item data is cached there and you will continue to see transmogs you've already seen if you do not empty the folder.
